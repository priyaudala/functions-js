        You are building a section of a program that needs to display even numbers between 1 and 10.
        Task Details:
        1. Write a function showEvenNumbers.
        2. Inside the function, loop through numbers from 1 to 10.
        3. Print only the even numbers to the console using console.log.
        4. Call the function to show the even numbers.
        Step-by-Step Subtasks:
        • Define the function showEvenNumbers.
        • Use a loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 10.
        • Inside the loop, use an if condition to check if a number is even.
